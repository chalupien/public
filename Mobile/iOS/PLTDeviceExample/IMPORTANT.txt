There is currently a problem referencing libPLTDevice.a in the PLTDeviceExample.xcodeproj file. The Xcode project uses an absolute path to the library. Therefore, on any computer other than that the project was created on, the project will not compile. To fix this error, open the Xcode project, select the "PLTDevice" group in the Project Navigator, use the menu Edit -> Delete, or press the Delete key on your keyboard. When prompted, click the "Remove References" button. Now re-add the library by dragging it from the Finder and dropping it into the Xcode project, or by selecting the menu File -> Add Files to “PLTDeviceExample”. When prompted, make sure PLTDeviceExample is checked under the “Add to targets” heading.
